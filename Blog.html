           <h2> Call of Duty WW2 Vanguard</h2>
           <article>Call of Duty 2021 rumours and leaks lead the cod community to believe that the next cod game will be Call of Duty WW2 Vanguard. Wich has been poorly recieved by the community. Alot of pressure is riding on Call of Duty 2021 to repair the damage caused by Call of duty Black Ops Cold War. With Warzone slowly loosing its players from all the problems not being fixed and continuing to ruin the game. Alot of players are going back to Call of Duty Modern Warfare wich was realeased in 2019. Usually a cod game has a one year life span, the producer has about one year to update the game and drop dlc's and make sure that the community is happy.Then when the new call of duty comes out by a different producer it gives them one year to creat the new one. Wich usually leads to alot of recycled content and cod games die really early. That is not the case with Cod Modern Warfare alot of people are going back to this game because of how much better it is then Cold War.Infinity Ward are still updating Modern warfare to this day wich is really rare because usually there attention would be to develope the next cod game. Overall the cod community is upset and dissapointed with the developers right now wich puts alot of pressure on Call of Duty 2021 being developed by Sledgehammer Games. The reason why the community is upset with the new WW2 call of duty is that there has already been a Cod WW2 game wich released in 2017 wich received bad reviews. So to see another WW2 game created by the same developers is very unasuring. Only time will tell. Roll back the clocks 6 or so years and we received Advanced Warfare a game poorly received by the community, with its advanced movement system and pay to win supply drop system wich gave those who paid a better chance to get overpowerd guns. The following cod game was Black ops 3 with the same movement system and same supply drop system wich in turn the fans were upset about. The next cod game was infinite warfare debatably the worst cod game to date. With the same problems as the Black ops 3 and Advanced Warfare. Fast forward till 2018 Black ops 4 releases and immideatly received pourly, right from the get go. Modern Warfare reales in 2019 and does a good job at reparing the community and making them happy and earning alot of older supportes back. Then out of no where Infinity Ward drops a battle royale game Warzone wich is received really well and has had over 100 million downloads. Over the years the game is begining to die out and lossing players due to broken guns such as ffar and m16 not being nerfed and abused by all the players wich puts anyone using a different gun at a significant disavantage. In a desperate attempt to fix there game, they have changed the map with a nuke event wich happend April 21 2021. We pray that with this new map update they update the guns and nerf the overpowered guns and overall fix there game and keep the cod community alive as this game is practically the only thing keeping call of duty alive, Cold war has failed to do so and the community is already disapointed with the WW2 Vanguard set to drop late 2021. All we can do is pray that they fix there game.</article>
